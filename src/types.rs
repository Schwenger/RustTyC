//! # Content
//! * [Variant] is a trait representing the variant of an abstract type that will be inferred during the type checking procedure.
//! * [Constructable]: A variant is constructable if it can be transformed into a concrete type, i.e., [Constructable::Type].
//! * [TypeTable] and [PreliminaryTypeTable] are mappings from a [TcKey] to a concrete [Constructable::Type] or [Preliminary] type.

/// A variant that will be inferred during the type checking procedure.
///
/// # Requirements
/// The variant needs to follow a [lattice structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)) where the top element is the least constrained, most abstract type variant
/// possible.
/// ## Refinement
/// The top value needs to be provided by the [Variant::top()] function.  Types will be refined
/// successively using the fallible [Variant::meet()] function.  If the types are incompatible, i.e., would result in a contradictory
/// type, the meet needs to return a [Variant::Err]. Note that [Variant::meet()] needs to follow the rules of abstract meets.
/// Intuitively, these are:
/// * The result of a meet needs to be more or equally concrete than either argument.
/// * Meeting two variants returns the greatest upper bound, i.e., the type variant that is more or equally concrete to either argument _and_ there is no other, less concrete type meeting this requirement.
/// This especially entails that meeting any type `T` with an unconstrained type returns `T`.
/// The arguments of the meet functions are [Partial], i.e., the combination of a variant and the least number of children the respective type has.
/// This is of particular interest for types that are not fully resolved and thus do not have a fixed arity, yet.  An unconstained type variant could have
/// a sub-type because it will be later determined to be an "Option" or "Tuple" type.  More details in the next section.
///
/// ## Arity
/// Type can be recursive, i.e., they have a number of subtypes, their "children".
/// An integer, for example, has no children and is thus 0-ary.  An optional type on the other hand is 1-ary, tuples might have an arbitrary arity.
/// During the inference process, the arity might be undetermined:  the unconstrained type will resolve to something with an arity, but the value is not clear, yet.
/// Hence, its least arity is initially 0 and potentially increases when more information was collected.
///
/// The type checking procedure keeps track of types and their potential children.
/// For this, it requires some guarantees when it comes to the arity:
///
/// ### Arity Stability
/// The meet of two variants must not _reduce_ its arity.  For example, meeting a pair with fixed arity 2 and a triple with fixed arity 3 may not result in a variant with fixed arity 1.
/// It may, however, result in a variant with variable arity.
///
/// # Example
/// For a full example of an abstract type system, refer to the [crate documentation](../index.html) and the examples.
///
/// # Context
/// If the variant requires a context for the meet and/or equality operation, refer to [ContextSensitiveVariant].
/// Each [Variant] automatically implements [ContextSensitiveVariant].
///
